debug.require: >
  Using `$(module)` to handle "$(intent)".

error.bump-level: >
  Bump level "$(level)" not recognized. Valid bump levels are "major", "minor"
  and "patch", as specified by the Semantic Version specification. You can read
  about which level to use when in the documentation on $(module).
error.command.missing: >
  The "$(command)" program is not available on this system. Please use your
  operating system's package manager to install it.
error.meta6: >
  No META6.json in $(path). Are you sure you're in a Perl 6 module directory?
  You can specify the path to a module to work with using `--module=<path>` if
  needed.
error.meta6.missing-key: >
  The `$(key)` key is missing in the module's META6.json. Either set it using
  `assixt meta source-url <url>`, or use `--force` to ignore this error.
error.subcommand: >
  Unknown subcommand "$(command)". Read the documentation on $(docs) for a list
  of available subcommands.
error.unknown.main: >
  Unrecognized command "$(command)". You can get a quick synopsis of assixt by
  running it with `--help`.  You can find a list of possible commands with a
  small description in the documentation for App::Assixt, which you can read
  with `p6man App::Assixt`.
error.subcommand.missing: >
  The "$(command)" command requires a specific subcommand to be given. For a
  list of available subcommands for "$(command)", check the $(docs)
  documentation.

bump: >
  $(module) bumped to v$(version).

config.unknown: >
  Invalid configuration key "$(option)". For a list of available configuration
  keys used in assixt, read the documentation on App::Assixt::Config.
config.updated: >
  Configuration updated.

depend: >
  $(dependency) has been added as a dependency to $(module).
depend.zef: >
  Failed to install $(module) with Zef, not adding the dependency. You can skip
  the local installation and just add the dependency to your module by adding
  `--no-install` to the command.

dist: >
  Created the distribution tarball at $(path).
dist.conflict: >
  A distribution tarball already exists at $(path). Remove this file or run
  this command again with `--force` to ignore this error.
dist.readme: >
  No usable README file found! Add a README.pod6 using `assixt touch meta
  readme.pod6`, or use `--force` to skip this check.
dist.readme.dependency: >
  You need $(module) to use Pod 6 documents as README. You can install this
  with zef, by running `zef install $(module)`. Alternatively, run this command
  again with `--force` to ignore this error.

new: >
  Created module skeleton for $(module) in $(path).
new.conflict: >
  The target directory $(directory) is not empty. Please remove the file or
  directory at this path or use `--force` to ignore this error and attempt
  creating the module directory anyway. Alternatively, specify a different name
  to use for the module.

touch: >
  Added $(type) $(file) to $(module).
touch.conflict: >
  A file already exists at $(path). Remove the file, or run this command again
  with `--force` to ignore this error.

  Your user credentials were incorrect, please re-try entering your
  credentials. If you are sure your credentials are correct, hit the enter key
  to retry those credentials.
upload.conflict: >
  The distribution you're trying to upload conflicts with an existing file on
  CPAN. You should probably update the version of your module. You can do this
  with `assixt bump`. Create a new distribution with `assixt dist` after that,
  and try to upload the new dist.
upload.gave-up: >
  Uploading to CPAN failed, gave up after $(tries) unsuccesful tries.
